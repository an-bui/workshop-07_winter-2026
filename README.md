Week 7 workshop: linear models

This is a README! It tells you what is in the GitHub repo.

All READMEs for this class should have the following sections:

## General information

**What is this repo for?**  
This repo contains files demonstrating the workflow for fitting, checking, and visualizing linear models.  

**Whose repo is it? Who is contributing to it?**  
This is a repo forked from the `ENVS-193DS-2026` organization. I am the sole contributor.

## Data and file information

**What files are there?**  
All code files are in the `code` folder. The abalone-pH example is in the `abalone-example.qmd` file. The temperature-elevation example is in the `sonadora-temperature-example.qmd` file.  

All data files are in the `data` folder. The abalone-pH data is in the `Abalone IMTA_growth and pH.xlsx` file and the temperature elevation data is in the `Temp_SonadoraGradient_Daily.csv` file.  

**What code is there, and what does it do?**  
The code in both `.qmd` files demonstrates how to fit linear models.

## Rendered output

The rendered output for the abalone-pH example is [here](https://an-bui.github.io/workshop-07_winter-2026/code/abalone-example.html).  

**Note!** in 9 AM, we did not render the second example in `sonadora-temperature-example.qmd`. You can render your version and find the deployed URL to include in your README.  

The rendered output for the temperature-elevation example is [here](https://an-bui.github.io/workshop-07_winter-2026/code/sonadora-temperature-example.html).
